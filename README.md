## Introduction

This is a draft and proposal for implementation of the process for domain name creation via the DK Hostmaster EPP portal/service.

<a id="about-this-document"></a>
### About this Document

We have adopted the term RFC (_Request For Comments_), due to the recognition in the term and concept, so this document is a process supporting document, aiming to serve the purpose of obtaining a common understanding of the proposed implementation and to foster discussion on the details of the implementation. The final specification will be lifted into the [DK Hostmaster EPP Service Specification][DKHMEPPSPEC] implementation and this document will be closed for comments and the document no longer be updated.

### XML and XSD Examples

All example XML files are available in the [DK Hostmaster EPP XSD repository][DKHMXSDSPEC].

## Description

DK Hostmaster are extending the registry capabilities to support _one-stop-shop_ so registrars and registrants will have the option to pick and model for domain name administration with suit their requirements.

As for the proposal for support for the EPP transfer command, described in the RFC: "[DKHM RFC for Transfer Domain EPP Command][DKHMRFCTRANSFER]", support for specifying the sponsoring client has to be supported for several of the EPP commands:

- `create domain`
- `create contact`
- `create host`

The goal is to support the standard to the extent possible. Changing the behavior might not suit everybody and this proposal aims to address this.

## Domain Creation, Maintenance and Deletion

The default behavior of the EPP `create domain` command as described in [RFC:5731][RFC5731], will attach the client-ID (`CLID`) of the authenticated party to the object created.

## Contact Creation, Maintenance and Deletion

The default behavior of the EPP `create contact` command as described in [RFC:5733][RFC5733], will attach the client-ID (`CLID`) of the authenticated party to the object created, just as for the domain creation described above.

The contact object will be under the sponsoring party throughout it's _life-cycle_ and transfer of contact objects will not be explicitly supported. See our proposal for transfer support described in our RFC: "[DKHM RFC for Transfer Domain EPP Command][DKHMRFCTRANSFER]".

Deletion will not be supported either and will work as it currently is implemented in the DK Hostmaster EPP service and described in the specification. See the section: "[Unimplemented commands](https://github.com/DK-Hostmaster/epp-service-specification#unimplemented-commands)" for details. Contact objects are automatically delete, under the following policy:

- The contact object is not in use
- It holds not roles/association with other objects
- The associated financial account holds a balance of 0
- It has been inactive for 45 days

The maintenance will also be limited, since DK Hostmaster locks contact objects for changes if these have been matched to a register for name and address information, this applies to:

- Danish citizens of the type individual, bound to the CPR register
- Danish companies, public organizations and associations of the types, bound to the CVR register

The following contact types are also limited, due to the VAT number validation:

- EU/EÃ˜S companies, public organizations and associations of the types, bound to the EU Vies register

All other types has to be maintained by the sponsoring client, with the exception of the name.
